ArrNorm is a command-line tool for relative radiometric normalization of multispectral remote sensing imagery. Given a reference image and one or more target images acquired over the same area at different dates, it produces normalized outputs whose reflectance values are statistically consistent with the reference — compensating for differences caused by sensor angle, sun position, atmospheric conditions, and seasonal variation.

Normalization relies on the **IR-MAD** algorithm (Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection) to automatically identify *no-change* pixels shared by both images and use them to calibrate a per-band linear transform. [[1]](#references)

## Algorithm overview

The pipeline has three main stages:

### 1. Alignment

Before any statistics are computed the reference image is reprojected and resampled onto the target's exact pixel grid (same CRS, same spatial extent, same number of pixels) using `gdal.Warp` with bilinear resampling. This guarantees pixel-for-pixel spatial coincidence, which is a hard requirement for the IR-MAD covariance computations. If the two images already share an identical grid the step is skipped.

### 2. IR-MAD — invariant pixel detection

The Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) transformation finds *K* pairs of linear combinations of the spectral bands — the **MAD variates** — such that each pair is maximally different between the two dates. For *K* bands the *i*-th MAD variate is:

```
MAD_i = a_i^T · X  −  b_i^T · Y
```

where **X** and **Y** are the reference and target band vectors, and the coefficient vectors **a** and **b** are the solutions of a pair of coupled generalized eigenproblems involving the between-date cross-covariance matrix. The corresponding **canonical correlation** ρᵢ measures how similar the two images are in that combination of bands: ρᵢ → 1 means no change, ρᵢ → 0 means complete change. The variance of each MAD variate is 2(1 − ρᵢ).

Under the null hypothesis of *no change*, the standardized MAD variates

```
χ² = Σ_i  (MAD_i / √(2(1 − ρᵢ)))²
```

follow a chi-squared distribution with *K* degrees of freedom. The **no-change probability** NCP = P(χ² ≥ observed) is then used as a pixel weight for the next iteration: stable pixels get weight ≈ 1, changed pixels get weight ≈ 0.

The **iterative reweighting** loop drives the covariance statistics toward being estimated entirely from invariant ground, progressively suppressing changed pixels. Two independent thresholds govern the pipeline:

- **Convergence level** τ_conv: iteration stops when δ = max|ρ_new − ρ_old| falls below 1 − τ_conv, or when the maximum number of iterations is reached. Higher values enforce tighter convergence (e.g. τ_conv = 0.99 stops when δ < 0.01). When the iteration limit is reached, the result with the smallest δ is selected automatically.

- **No-change probability threshold** τ_ncp: after IR-MAD converges, only pixels whose no-change probability NCP exceeds τ_ncp are admitted to the per-band orthogonal regression in RadCal. Higher values select fewer but more reliable invariant pixels.

### 3. RadCal — radiometric calibration

Using the no-change pixels identified by IR-MAD (those with NCP > τ_ncp), ArrNorm fits a per-band **orthogonal (total-least-squares) regression** of target onto reference:

```
Y_normalized = a + b · Y_target
```

Orthogonal regression is used because both images contain measurement noise, so minimizing residuals in both directions gives a more accurate calibration line than ordinary least squares. The coefficients are applied to the full target image to produce the normalized output.

Pixel values are affected by sensor angle, sun position, atmospheric conditions, and seasonal variation; ArrNorm compensates for all of these. Use the same display style (copy/paste style in QGIS) across all layers when comparing before and after.*

The IR-MAD algorithm and the radiometric normalization procedure implemented here are described in detail in Chapter 9 of that book. The iterative reweighting scheme, the use of the chi-squared no-change probability as pixel weights, and the orthogonal regression calibration all follow Canty's formulation directly.
